# flink-connector-rmqstreams

This a Flink Connector (Source and Sink) for [RabbitMQ Streams](https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html).

The [standard connector](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/connectors/datastream/rabbitmq/) 
builds on the RabbitMQ [standard library](https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html) and enforces auto acknowledgements.  
This connector uses the [RabbitMQ Stream](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-java-client) java client.
